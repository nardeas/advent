-- DAY 6:
--
-- The reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds
-- the memory bank with the most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered
-- memory bank) and redistributes those blocks among the banks. To do this,
-- it removes all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the
-- next (by index) memory bank and inserts one of the blocks. It continues
-- doing this until it runs out of blocks; if it reaches the last memory
-- bank, it wraps around to the first one.
--
-- The debugger would like to know how many redistributions can be done
-- before a blocks-in-banks configuration is produced that has been seen before.
